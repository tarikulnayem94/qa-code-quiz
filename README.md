# QA Testing Quiz

### Scenario

The frontend team has developed a prototype login portal for an up and coming platform.
However, they have not implemented any testing yet and it is up to you to do so.

As the QA developer, what is tested and how it is tested is up to you.
Management simply asks that these tests provide as much evidence as possible of the platform's reliability.

### Notes

- Submission must include a link to a public fork/clone of this repository
- We typically use Jest for testing node.js/API related logic and Cypress for testing UI functionality, however, you are more than welcome to use any testing framework you desire so long as you are able to provide reasonable justification

---

## ✅ Testing Implementation Completed

This repository now includes a comprehensive testing suite that provides extensive evidence of the platform's reliability.

### 🧪 Test Coverage Summary

- **Total Tests**: 50 unit tests + comprehensive E2E test suites
- **Code Coverage**: 98.46% statement coverage
- **Testing Frameworks**: Jest (unit tests) + Cypress (E2E tests)
- **Test Types**: Component tests, integration tests, authentication flows, API tests

### 🚀 Quick Start

#### Run All Available Tests

```bash
npm test
```

#### Run Only Unit Tests

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

#### Run Unit Tests with Coverage

```bash
npm run test:unit -- --coverage
```

#### Run E2E Tests

```bash
# Start the test server first
NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider" npm run start:test

# In another terminal, run E2E tests
npx cypress run

# Or open Cypress UI
npx cypress open
```

#### Use the Test Runner Script

```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

### 📊 What's Tested

#### Unit Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)

- **Authentication Context**: Login/logout logic, state management
- **Login Component**: Form interactions, credential validation
- **Account Component**: User data display, logout functionality
- **Header Component**: Dynamic content based on auth state
- **App Component**: Conditional rendering and navigation

#### End-to-End Tests (Cypress)

- **Login Flows**: Valid/invalid credentials, form validation
- **Account Management**: User data display, logout workflows
- **Navigation & UI**: Responsive design, accessibility, user experience
- **API Integration**: Backend CRUD operations (when available)

#### Integration Tests

- Component interactions and state transitions
- Authentication flow end-to-end
- Error handling and edge cases
